                        He puts together a memo each week and releases it to his team on Mondays. 
                        This memo directs his team to the most favorable areas by calling out the areas with the worst weather conditions.
                        He also updates it daily as weather conditions change to get his team the most relevant information.
                        All the information is pulled from The Weather Watch and its local town pages.

                        Matthew James is a hard working father. He loves rock climbing and tries to work it into his schedule as much as possible.
                        There are many factors that stop him from doing it all the time like school, work and family but then other than that the only thing
                        that stops him is the weather. To preserve the rocks and to keep the climbers safe its important to only climb in the best conditions.
                        Once Matthew gets the itch for climbing he instantly hits The Weather Watch to see if its even a possibility.
